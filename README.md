# Malware Analysis Tool with GUI

## Overview

This Python project is a malware analysis tool that combines various analysis techniques with a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user interaction. Users can select a malware sample through the GUI, triggering a comprehensive analysis that includes file properties, hash calculations, and, if needed, dynamic analysis.

## Features

- **File Properties:** Extracts and displays basic file information, such as size, type, and permissions.
- **Hash Calculations:** Generates hash values (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) for the selected file.
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Conducts dynamic analysis if enabled, observing the file's behavior in a controlled environment.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Utilizes the `tkinter` library for a simple and interactive graphical interface.
